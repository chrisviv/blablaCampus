# blablaCampus

Project display:

- The goal of the BlablaCampus project was to create a PWA that could be communicated to each new learner 
  so that they could quickly find a carpooling solution to get to their training if they wish.

The objectives are:

  - To allow students newly arrived at school to find a means of transport, other than the bus or
    train to get to school. A carpooling solution would allow moments of exchange and conviviality.
    
  - If necessary, agreements could be put in place between the participants in order to subsidize the fuel expenses.
  
  - However, be careful, there is no question of setting up a trip monetization system.
  
  Cibles:
  
  - This application will mainly target the students of the school provided by Onlineformapro in Lons-le-Saunier sector.
  
  Project scope :
  
  - This site is expected to be viewable on computer and mobile via an internet browser. 
  - But it is also expected a Progressive Web App to facilitate the speed of access to the website.
  - The site must be coded mainly in PHP, preferably object-oriented. 
  - Javascript may also be put into place in order to make the site more dynamic.
  - In the administration, the use of an API must be imperative for the input of cities so that no error is committed during the input of these.
